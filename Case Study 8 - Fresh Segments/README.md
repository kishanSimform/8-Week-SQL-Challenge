# Fresh Segments

---

## Introduction

Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyze trends in online ad click behavior for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyze aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.
